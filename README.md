# frontend-examples
Examples using existing Angular and alternative React frameworks.  I wrote this to demonstrate how to use the Leavetown API to simplify the construction of a back-end agnostic front end.  I hope you get some inspiration from these examples. 

# How to use: 

## installation: 
` npm install `

## run the server
` gulp `

Note: this will run a gulp process (see: gulpfile.js) that will compile your sass (`/style/sass`) watch for changes & livereload.  You can buy me a beer sometime. 

## To see angular in action
go to `localhost:2772/index.html`. 
Note: the angular code (`js/ng.js`) that runs this is identical to the ng.js file found on the leavetown website, except for lines 385-400 which handle a different (arguably better) implementation of a date selector. 

## To see some react in action
go to `localhost:2772/index-react.html`
Note that the react code is found in `js/react-properties.js`.  

Cheers!
